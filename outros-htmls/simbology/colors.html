            <h2>Color Analysis in "Alice's Adventures in Wonderland"</h2>
            <p>The use of color in "Alice's Adventures in Wonderland" plays a significant role in conveying the story's
                themes and emotions. Each color reflects the various aspects of Alice's journey through Wonderland,
                influencing the mood and atmosphere of the narrative.</p>
            <p>One of the most prominent colors is blue, often associated with Alice herself. Her iconic blue dress
                symbolizes innocence, curiosity, and the spirit of adventure. This color creates a sense of calmness and
                stability amid the chaos of Wonderland, representing Alice's quest for understanding and identity.</p>
            <p>The color red, frequently associated with the Queen of Hearts, signifies power, anger, and danger. The
                Queen's red attire, along with the red roses in the garden, evokes a sense of foreboding and the
                oppressive nature of authority. This contrast with Alice's blue highlights the struggle between
                innocence and the harsh realities of adulthood.</p>
            <p>Green is another important color, often representing growth and transformation. The lush green landscapes
                of Wonderland symbolize Alice's personal growth as she navigates through various challenges. Green also
                evokes a sense of vitality and wonder, reflecting the enchanting aspects of Wonderland.</p>
            <p>Finally, black and white are used to depict the dichotomy of order and chaos. The contrasting colors can
                be seen in the chessboard patterns and the characters themselves, such as the Black and White Queens in
                "Through the Looking-Glass." This duality reflects the complexities of life and the ever-present balance
                between opposing forces.</p>
            <p>In conclusion, the colors in "Alice's Adventures in Wonderland" enhance the narrative by embodying the
                themes of innocence, authority, growth, and the balance between order and chaos. They contribute to the
                rich tapestry of imagery that makes the story timeless and evocative.</p>
