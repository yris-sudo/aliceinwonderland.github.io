        <h1>Overview</h1>
        <p>"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland" is a timeless classic written by Lewis Carroll that follows the
            inquisitive young girl, Alice, on a fantastical journey through a whimsical and absurd world. The story
            begins on a lazy summer afternoon when Alice, feeling bored with her surroundings, spots a hurried White
            Rabbit wearing a waistcoat and holding a pocket watch. Driven by curiosity, she decides to follow him,
            tumbling down a rabbit hole that transports her into a bizarre realm where the usual rules of logic and
            reality are turned upside down.</p>

        <p>As Alice navigates through Wonderland, she encounters an array of eccentric characters who challenge her
            perception of the world. Among these are the eccentric Mad Hatter, who hosts perpetual "unbirthday" tea
            parties, the mysterious Cheshire Cat, who can appear and disappear at will, leaving only his wide grin
            behind, and the tyrannical Queen of Hearts, infamous for her decree "Off with their heads!" Each encounter
            is filled with paradoxes, riddles, and whimsical challenges that force Alice to question her understanding
            of logic, identity, and societal norms.</p>

        <p>The narrative not only explores the chaos and unpredictability inherent in childhood but also reflects how
            children often perceive the adult world as bewildering and nonsensical. Throughout her journey, Alice faces
            trials that symbolize her transition from the innocence of childhood to a deeper understanding of adult
            complexities. Her adventure ultimately culminates in a personal revelation: that even in a world where
            everything seems mad, there is intrinsic value in embracing the unknown and seeking self-discovery. In the
            end, Alice's journey serves as a metaphor for growing up, where every surreal experience contributes to her
            understanding of herself and her place in the world.</p>
